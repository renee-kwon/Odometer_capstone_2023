# MDS ICBC Capstone Project - Teamwork Contract

## Team Members:

### Students
- Bruce Wu
- Renee Kwon
- Roan Raina
- Hongjian(Sam) Li

### Mentor
- Simon Goring

Our team will support and respect each other throughout this project and abide by the Code of Conduct. 

## Contribution
We aim for equal contribution from all members. Division of work will be discussed in person, during group meetings, or online. GitHub will be used for version control and tracking tasks via Projects and Issues. If teammates are absent from meetings due or cannot complete assignments, they will communicate with the other teammates. 

## Communication
Members are expected to be available throughout the school day (9 am to 4 pm on Mondays through Fridays) through Slack communication. Messages may be sent outside these hours, but we will be cognizant and understanding of members’ personal schedules and family obligations. We will all try our best to accommodate each other’s schedules and respect others’ time.

Decisions should be tracked via GitHub Issues. 

We will ensure open communication and ensure members feel safe during the project.  

## Team Meetings
### Meeting Times
Meetings will be held at the following times:
- Daily standup: 10 am
- Weekly meeting with Client: Thursdays @ 1 pm
- Weekly meeting with Simon: TBD

Meeting times will be adjusted on a needs basis and according to project workload. 

### Meeting Minutes
Minutes will be taken at each meeting and shared electronically. The responsibility of minutes will be rotated among team members on a weekly basis, and a team member will be assigned at our Monday morning meeting.  During these meetings, we will discuss our progress, our next steps, our goals, and the distribution of project tasks. Members are expected to note topics they would like to discuss individually. 

## Work Quality Expectations.
Each member is expected to produce work of high quality by assigned deadlines. It is understood that the individual assigned to a task is responsible for its timely completion. If an individual needs support from the group or to modify timelines, they should let the team know as soon as possible. Team mates should not be unaware of challenges or expected missed deadlines during a client meeting. 

Learning and successful collaboration will be our main goals. If marks are deducted for a specific portion of our project, we are all responsible, not just the individual(s) who worked on it. We will learn from our mistakes as a team and make improvements for our next tasks and future projects to come.
